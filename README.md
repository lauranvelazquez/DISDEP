# DISEP

DISEP is a system developed to detect the areas with the highest risk of landslides. To do this, use indicators:
•Fire Hazard
•Risk of Floods
•Risk of Typhoons and Hurricanes
•Deforestation
•Mountain Transformations
•Elevation of the ground
•Risk of flooding

These data are obtained from various sensors, historical data and satellites, such as SAOCOM and MODIS. Some results of interest are presented with their probability of occurrence. They are shown in 3 colors:

•Red: High risk
•Yellow: Medium risk
•Green: No risk.

If a disaster was happening and was not detected, you can back it up. These data are analyzed and displayed on the map.
